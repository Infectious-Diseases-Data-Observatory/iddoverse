# Introduction

Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) a standardised format designed for data
storage. It provides a coherent framework for pooling data from multiple studies and clinical trials. However,
SDTM is not a suitable data format for analysis. Several complex data pivots are required
before graphing and analysing data is possible. This vignette walks through the \{iddoverse\} R package demonstrating key functions and results for users of Infectious Disease Data Observatory (IDDO) domains (datasets)
to transform information from long to wide configurations, designed to work independently or
within other functions. The package is designed to be user-friendly for a broad audience of
varying programming ability. Collectively, the code combines key information, selects variables
of interest, pivots them into a wide data format, adds extra functionality to provide further
insights and merges several domains together. Documentation for each function can be viewed in R, after installing the package, using the ? command. 

## Installing the Package

If you have not downloaded the \{iddoverse\} package before, or need to update the function, which is advised regularly, run the following code in the R console:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # Only run this line if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("RhysPeploe/iddoverse")
```

## Required Packages

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(iddoverse)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
```

# Categories of Function

There are broadly 5 types of action that a function could perform, namely:

* CLEAN: Performs a number of string replacements to correct commonly misspelt or foreign words and standardises synonyms to increase the homogeneity of the data.
* DERIVE: Computing or converting data to provide more functionality.
* PREP: Takes long format data then filters, manipulates and pivots to a wide format. CLEAN and some DERIVE actions are called by PREP functions.
* ANALYSE: Merges domains into one analysis dataset. Calls PREP and some DERIVE commands.
* JOIN: Combines variables which represent the same or similar information into a more concise set of features.

## CLEAN\_ Functions

A handful of domains are cleaned, the majority do not require this since the IDDO curation team uses controlled terminology, however, for some domains this is a significant and difficult task to standardise every treatment or adverse effect a subject could experience. Blood transfusions, for example, are represented by a number of different entries, yet are all the same intervention, INPRESP (whether the variable was pre-specified to be captured) and INOCCUR (whether the event occurred or not) are also standardised.

```{r}
IN <- data.frame(
  INTRT = c("BLOOD TRANSFUSION", "PACKED RED BLOOD CELLS", "WHOLE BLOOD 450ML", "TRANSFUSION"),
  INPRESP = c("Y", "Y", TRUE, NA),
  INOCCUR = c("Y", TRUE, FALSE, "UNKNOWN")
)

kable(IN)
kable(CLEAN_IN(IN))
```

## DERIVE\_ Functions

These commands provide new features or convert existing ones, in the below code, DERIVE\_SEASON takes the date and returns a new variable with the calendar season, DERIVE\_AGE\_DAYS provides a new column with the subject's age in days, while the DERIVE\_AGE\_YEARS converts existing age all to years. Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated and, if necessary, replaced by DERIVE\_BMI and DERIVE\_ANTHRO determines the z scores for World Health Organisation (WHO) growth standards for children under 5 years old. The new columns are seen in join_df.

```{r, fig.align='left'}
derive_df_raw <- data.frame(
  USUBJID = c("001", "002", "003", "004"),
  RFSTDTC = c(
    as.Date("2023/01/01"), as.Date("2023/04/01"),
    as.Date("2023/08/01"), as.Date("2023/12/01")
  ),
  AGE = c(35, 24, 4, 54),
  AGEU = c("YEARS", "MONTHS", "YEARS", "YEARS"),
  SEX = c(1, 2, 2, 1),
  HEIGHT = c(180, 97, 109, 155),
  WEIGHT = c(80, 10, 18, 67)
)

kable(derive_df_raw)
derive_df <- derive_df_raw %>%
  DERIVE_SEASON() %>%
  DERIVE_AGE_DAYS() %>%
  DERIVE_AGE_YEARS() %>%
  DERIVE_BMI()

join_df <- left_join(
  derive_df,
  derive_df %>% DERIVE_ANTHRO()
)
kable(join_df)
```

## PREP\_ Functions

Most domains require transformation from long format where there is one row per event, to a wider alternative where events and other variables are columns because it is more usual to analyse in the latter. This is performed in the PREP\_ set of tools which are all domain specific. Data is filtered and relevant columns are mutated to ensure the object classes are coercible, before data manipulation, if appropriate, and finally pivoting the data wider. Manipulation that is commonly performed is creating a new column to initially match the standardised result or decoded term, then where NAs exist, fill those cells with the modified results or terms, and if NAs still exist, fill the gaps with the original, contributor-provided data.

```{r}
lb_df <- data.frame(
  STUDYID = c(
    "RPTESTB", "RPTESTB", "RPTESTB", "RPTESTB", "RPTESTB", "RPTESTB",
    "RPTESTB", "RPTESTB", "RPTESTB", "RPTESTB"
  ),
  DOMAIN = "LB",
  USUBJID = c(
    "RPTESTB_001", "RPTESTB_001", "RPTESTB_001", "RPTESTB_002", "RPTESTB_002",
    "RPTESTB_002", "RPTESTB_002", "RPTESTB_003", "RPTESTB_003", "RPTESTB_003"
  ),
  LBTESTCD = c("HGB", "PLAT", "HGB", "HGB", "PLAT", "HGB", "HCG", "HGB", "PLAT", "HGB"),
  LBTEST = c(
    "Hemoglobin", "Platelets", "Hemoglobin", "Hemoglobin", "Platelets",
    "Hemoglobin", "Choriogonadotropin Beta", "Hemoglobin", "Platelets", "Hemoglobin"
  ),
  LBORRES = c("95", "181000", "88", "101", "100000", "99", "NEG", "98", "90000", "102"),
  LBMODIFY = NA,
  LBORRESU = c("g/L", "10^6/L", "g/L", "g/L", "10^6/L", "g/L", NA, "g/L", "10^6/L", "g/L"),
  LBSTRESC = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, "NEGATIVE", NA, NA, NA),
  LBSTRESN = c(95, 181, 88, 101, 100, 99, NA, 98, 90, 102),
  LBSTRESU = c("g/L", "10^9/L", "g/L", "g/L", "10^9/L", "g/L", NA, "g/L", "10^9/L", "g/L"),
  VISITNUM = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3),
  VISITDY = c(1, 3, 42, 1, 3, 42, 1, 1, 3, NA),
  EPOCH = c(
    "BASELINE", "TREATMENT", "FOLLOW UP", "BASELINE", "TREATMENT", "FOLLOW UP",
    "BASELINE", "BASELINE", "TREATMENT", "FOLLOW UP"
  ),
  LBDY = c(1, 3, 42, 1, 4, 40, 1, 2, 5, NA)
)

kable(lb_df)
kable(PREP_LB_BL(lb_df))
kable(PREP_LB_FU(lb_df))
```


## ANALYSE\_ Functions

Up until this stage, the domains have been transformed individually and remain separate. Within, ANALYSE\_ functions, they are merged in turn in order to produce the custom analysis dataset. These functions call the other DERIVE and PREP actions so users can solely interact with the ANAYLSE\_ functions, or use the constituent parts to make their own version. However, knowledge of the process and how the data is processed is advisable for understanding and due diligence; inspecting the resultant data is pivotal to catch potential errors. Any output composed using the code will depend on the quality of the data.

```{r}
# one,two more domains (dm-derive, in-clean/prep, lb - prep)
dm_df <- data.frame(
  STUDYID = c("RPTESTB", "RPTESTB", "RPTESTB"),
  DOMAIN = c("DM", "DM", "DM"),
  USUBJID = c("RPTESTB_001", "RPTESTB_002", "RPTESTB_003"),
  SUBJID = c("001", "002", "003"),
  RFSTDTC = c("2023/01", "2023/01", "2023/02"),
  DTHDTC = c("2023/08", NA, NA),
  DTHFL = c("Y", NA, NA),
  SITEID = c("OXFORD", "OXFORD", "OXFORD"),
  AGE = c(67, 18, 48),
  AGEU = c("YEARS", "YEARS", "MONTHS"),
  SEX = c("F", "F", "M"),
  RACE = c("White", "White", "White"),
  ETHNIC = c("British", "Irish", "British"),
  ARMCD = c("PBO", "TRT", "TRT"),
  ARM = c("PLACEBO", "TREATMENT", "TREATMENT"),
  COUNTRY = c("UK", "UK", "UK"),
  DMDTC = c("2023/01", "2023/01", "2023/02"),
  DMDY = c(1, 1, 1)
)

kable(dm_df)
sa_df <- data.frame(
  STUDYID = c("RPTESTB", "RPTESTB", "RPTESTB"),
  DOMAIN = c("SA", "SA", "SA"),
  SASEQ = c(1, 1, 1),
  USUBJID = c("RPTESTB_001", "RPTESTB_002", "RPTESTB_001"),
  SATERM = c("Fever", "P/F-MALARIA", "P/F-MALARIA"),
  SAMODIFY = c(NA, NA, NA),
  SADECOD = c("FEVER", NA, NA),
  SACAT = c("MEDICAL HISTORY", NA, NA),
  SAPRESP = c(NA, NA, NA),
  SAOCCUR = c(NA, NA, NA),
  SASEV = c("SEVERE", "SEVERE", NA),
  VISITNUM = c(1, 2, 3),
  VISIT = c("Day 0", "Day 2", "Week 6"),
  VISITDY = c(1, 3, 42),
  EPOCH = c("BASELINE", "TREATMENT", "FOLLOW UP"),
  SADTC = c("2023/01", "2023/01", "2023/02"),
  SADY = c(NA, 4, NA),
  SASTDY = c(-18, NA, 39),
  SAENDY = c(-4, NA, 42),
  SADUR = c(NA, NA, NA),
  SAEVINTX = c(NA, NA, NA)
)

kable(sa_df)

baseline_df <- ANALYSE_BASELINE(" ",
  DATA_DM = dm_df,
  DATA_LB = lb_df,
  DATA_MB = NULL,
  DATA_SA = sa_df
)

kable(baseline_df)
follow_up_df <- ANALYSE_FOLLOW_UP("VL",
  DATA_DM = dm_df,
  DATA_LB = lb_df,
  DATA_MB = NULL,
  DATA_SA = sa_df
)
```


## JOIN\_ Functions

After merging several domains into one dataset, there are a number of similar variables which exist and there is reason to merge these features together to avoid confusion. Several combinations of pregnancy test result (HCG) and Pregnancy Indicator (PREGIND), with the resultant, joined PREGNANT variable are shown below. In this case, the lab result, HCG, is more reliable than the response given when a subject is asked whether they are pregnant, PREGIND, so the PREGNANT variable will take the HCG value by default and if that is missing, will then take the PREGIND information. In the analysis dataset, only PREGNANT will appear, if both HCG and PREGIND were present in the original SDTM data.

```{r}
join_df_raw <- data.frame(
  HCG = c("POSITIVE", "POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE", NA, NA),
  PREGIND = c("POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE", NA, "POSITIVE", NA)
)

join_df_raw

join_df <- cbind(
  join_df_raw,
  join_df_raw %>% JOIN_PREGNANT()
)

join_df

# analyse (rp-join)
```


## Other Functions

### DOMAIN_TABLE

To easily assess the variables in a domain, the DOMAIN_TABLE() function uses table() to display the frequency of terms, tests and treatments so that the user can specify additional variables in the PREP\_ and ANALYSE\_ steps. Demographic (DM) variables are the various column names, most domains this will be the TESTCD, such as in the Laboratory Test Results (LB). 

```{r}
DOMAIN_TABLE("dm", dm_df)

DOMAIN_TABLE("lb", lb_df)
```
